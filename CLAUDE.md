- `npm run build` - Build frontend assets
- `composer dev` - Start development server with queue, logs and Vite

## Linting & Formatting
- `npm run lint` - Lint JavaScript/TypeScript files
- `npm run lint:fix` - Lint and fix JS/TS files
- `npm run types` - Check TypeScript types
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `composer exec vendor/bin/pint` - Format PHP code

## Testing
- `./vendor/bin/pest` - Run all PHP tests
- `./vendor/bin/pest --filter TestName` - Run specific PHP test
- `./vendor/bin/pest --coverage` - Run PHP tests with coverage
- `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` - Static analysis (level 5)
- `./vendor/bin/rector` - Automated code refactoring
- `npm test` - Run all Vitest tests for Vue components
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest UI

## Code Style
- PHP: PSR-12 with Laravel conventions (see pint.json)
- JS/TS: 4 spaces indentation, single quotes
- Vue: Use Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Strict typing in PHP and TypeScript
- Imports should be organized alphabetically
- Use Laravel's exception handling for errors
- Follow Laravel's naming conventions

## Frontend Testing
- Tests are written using Vitest and Vue Test Utils
- Component tests should be placed alongside components
- Mock external dependencies including InertiaJS and external libraries
- Tests should verify both rendering and functionality
- Test files use the `.test.ts` extension
- Focus on user interaction and accessibility

  - Favor dependency injection and service containers.

  PHP/Laravel
  - Use PHP 8.2+ features when appropriate (e.g., typed properties, match expressions).
  - Follow PSR-12 coding standards.
  - Use strict typing: declare(strict_types=1);

  - Implement proper database migrations and seeders.

  Dependencies
  - Laravel (latest stable version)
  - InertiaJS with Vue 3
  - Composer for dependency management
  - Vue 3 with TypeScript (Composition API)
  - TailwindCSS version 4
  - Roles and permissions in the Laravel app are managed by the "spatie/laravel-permission" Laravel plugin.

  Laravel Best Practices
